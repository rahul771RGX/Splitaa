Git change report for repository: Splitaa
Date: 2025-11-07 (UTC)
Branch: main

Summary (parsed from `git status --porcelain`):

Modified (tracked files with changes):
 - admin/src/app/services/admin.service.ts (modified)
 - client/package-lock.json (modified)
 - client/package.json (modified)

Deleted (tracked files removed):
 - client/.env.example (deleted)
 - server/.env.example (deleted)

Untracked (new files/directories):
 - splita/  (untracked directory)

Raw porcelain output:
 M admin/src/app/services/admin.service.ts
 D client/.env.example
 M client/package-lock.json
 M client/package.json
 D server/.env.example
?? splita/

How to interpret:
 - Lines starting with ' M' are modified tracked files.
 - Lines starting with ' D' are tracked files deleted in working tree.
 - Lines starting with '??' are untracked files or directories.

Next steps you can run locally:
 - Preview full status: git status
 - See staged changes: git status --short (same as porcelain)
 - Show diffs: git diff <file>
 - Add a file to staging: git add <path>
 - Discard local changes for a file: git restore <path>

Tracking automation (I created `track_changes.bat` which you can run to append snapshots to this report):
 - To run: open cmd at repository root and run `track_changes.bat`
 - It will append a timestamped `git status --porcelain` snapshot to `git-change-report.txt`.

If you'd like, I can:
 - Stage and commit the `track_changes.bat` for you and push it (confirm if you want that),
 - Or create a PowerShell or Node script instead (if you prefer),
 - Or set up a simple Git alias to run this snapshot command.
